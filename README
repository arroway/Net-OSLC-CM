       Net::OSLC::CM − module to help implement a OSLC client for Change
       Management

       This document describes Net::OSLC::CM version 0.01

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Net::OSLC::CM provides a Perl interface to help implement OSLC‐CM
       Consumers according to OSLC specifications described at
       open−services.net.  In the current state, this module implements
       function to retrieve changeRequests from Service Providers and Service
       Providers Catalog.  It uses HTTP basic authentication to connect to the
       distant changeRequest database.

       An example of use:

         use Net::OSLC::CM;

         my $oslccm = Net::OSLC::CM−>new(
                         url      => $self−>remote_url,
                         username => $username,
                         password => $password
         ));

         # Getting an array of changeRequests from the changeRequest database (array of Net::OSLC::CM::ChangeRequest objects)
         my @results = $oslccm−>get_oslc_resources;

       get_oslc_resources is a wrap function that calls successively the
       following:

         $oslccm−>url = "http://example.com";

         # RDF data parser
         $oslccm−>parser(
           Net::OSLC::CM::Parser−>new(cm => $oslccm)
         );

         # Assumes it'll get a Service Providers Catalog
         $oslccm−>create_catalog;

         # Gets the catalog (assuming it does exists to get the Service Providers information)
         $oslccm−>get_provider_catalog_resource;

         # Retrieves URLs of the Service Providers given by the Catalog
         $oslccm−>get_service_providers;

         # Gets changeRequests URLs from each Service Provider, creates a Net::OSLC::CM::ChangeRequest object and
         # pushes it into the $oslccm−>changeRequests array
         $oslccm−>get_changeRequests($oslccm−>providers);

         # Gets data for each changeRequest
         $oslccm−>load_changeRequests();

         my @results = $oslccm−>changeRequests;

       Net::OSLC::CM relies on:

       ·   Net::OSLC::CM::Connection

       ·   Net::OSLC::CM::Parser

       ·   Net::OSLC::CM::Catalog

       ·   Net::OSLC::CM::ServiceProvider

       ·   Net::OSLC::CM::ChangeRequest

       ·   Net::OSLC::CM::Util

MMEETTHHOODDSS
       "new ( $url, $username, $password )"
           Returns a new Net::OSLC::CM object to make a connection to the
           changeRequest database of given $url.  When the distant database
           requires HTTP basic authentication, you provide a username and a
           password at the creation.

       "get_oslc_resources"
           Returns an array of Net::OSLC::CM::ChangeRequest objects.

       "get_provider_catalog_resource"
           Gets if it exists the Service Provider Catalog as a
           Net::OSLC::CM::Catalog object and performs a query to get the
           referenced Service Providers .  An OSLC Service Provider Catalog
           Document describes a catalog whose entries describe service
           providers or out‐of‐line subcatalogs.  OSLC CM service providers
           must provide a Service Provider Resource and *MAY* provide a
           Service Provider Catalog Resource.

       "create_catalog"
           Creates an instance of the Net::OSLC::CM:Catalog class.

       "get_service_providers"
           Populates an array of Service Providers objects.

       "_get_service_providers ( $provider )"
           For a given Catalog, gets the resources and properties for the
           provided Net::OSLC::CM::ServiceProvider object: queryCapability,
           resourceShape and creationFactory.

       _Q_u_e_r_y _C_a_p_a_b_i_l_i_t_y

       Enables clients to query across a collection of resources via HTTP GET
       or POST.  To perform an HTTP GET query, an OSLC client starts with the
       base URI as defined by the oslc:queryBase property of a Query
       Capability, and appends to it query parameters in a syntax supported by
       the service.

       _R_e_s_o_u_r_c_e _S_h_a_p_e

       In some cases, to create resources and to query those that already
       exist within an OSLC Service, OSLC clients needs a way to learn which
       properties are commonly used in or required by the service. Resource
       Shape Resources meet this need by providing a machine‐readable
       definition of an OSLC resource type.  A Resource Shape describes the
       properties that are allowed or required by one type of resource.
       Resource Shapes are intended to provide simple "hints" to clients at
       resource creation, update or query time.

       _C_r_e_a_t_i_o_n _F_a_c_t_o_r_y

       Enables clients to create new resources via HTTP POST.

       "get_changeRequests"
             Wrapping function to get every changeRequest from every Service Provider enlisted and its attributes.

       "_get_changeRequest ( $model )"
           Populates an array of Net::OSLC::CM::ChangeRequest objects. Takes
           in argument a RDF::Trine::Model object with the RDF model that was
           parsed from the RDF data.

       "load_changeRequests"
           Loads the attributes (id, title, creator, description...) of the
           changeRequests by calling the _l_o_a_d_(_) method of the
           Net:OSLC::CM::ChangeRequest class. See Net::OSLC::CM::ChangeRequest
           documentation for more information.
